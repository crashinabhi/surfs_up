# Summary Statistics Analysis

## Project Overview
This analysis is mainly being conducted to compare 2 months of a year mainly June and December with regards to the temperatures in those months which will later be used to understand the best time for the year for the surf shop to do business.

## Results

1. Both the months June and December have around 200 observation for temperature. 
2. Month of June has a mean of 77.21 deg F with the lowest being 71 deg and the highest being 83 deg. The Std Dev is around 2.62
3. The month of December has a mean of 71.13 deg F with lowest being 60 deg and the highest being 78 deg. The Std Dev is around 3.41

## Summary

1. On comparing the temperature summary for the 2 months of June and December its evident that June has higher temperatures as compared to December.
2. These higher temps mean more foot fall during the month. June temperatures have lower deviations which means there is lower rise or drop in temperatures during the month. This is not true in the case of December as the temperatures are lower it means lower foot fall and higher standard deviation means the temperature variations are more during the month.
3. In addition to this we can also perform additional queries to understand the temperature variations during the day for both the months as well as temperature during the months besides these 2 months to propose a business for a certain season of the year.
4. We can also run an analysis to understand the precipitation happening during these 2 months to understand the rainfall related info for these months as these will help to drive the decision on the best month for surfing business.
